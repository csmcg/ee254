%% Chapter 6: Roots: Open Methods
% * Recognizing the difference between bracketing and open methods for root location.
% * Understanding the fixed-point iteration method and how you can evaluate its convergence characteristics.
% * Knowing how to solve a roots problem with the Newton-Raphson method and appreciating the concept of quadratic convergence.
% * Knowing how to implement both the secant and the modified secant methods.
% * Knowing how to use MATLAB’s fzero function to estimate roots.
% * Learning how to manipulate and determine the roots of polynomials with MATLAB.
