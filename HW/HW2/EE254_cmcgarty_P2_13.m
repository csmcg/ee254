% If a force 
% $F(N)$
% is applied to compress a spring, its displacement
% $x(m)$
% can often be modeled by Hooke's law:
%
% $$F=kx$$
%
% where 
% $k=$
% the spring constant (N/m). The potential energy stored in the spring
% $U(J)$
% can then be computed as
%
% $$U=\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
%
% Five springs are tested and the following data compiled:
