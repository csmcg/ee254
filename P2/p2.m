%approx integration of sin(x), error thresh = 0.001, 0 to 2pi, show n 
% for all the different methods 
% something with fixed?

% sin(x) and cos(x), other functions too
% use the methods: left hand rect, right hand rect, midpoint, and the
% others from table 19.2

% table:
% function | method | n | error | xmin | xmax | area
